# Image-Compression
Image compression using DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation)

This project is done as a term project
In this, code I've used DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation) technique for compressing the image.
And here I used two methods to do this

And please note that, you give your own directory for saving the images and loading the images

Thank you
